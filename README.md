Common shared code that is used across many of my projects. Feel free to use the NuGet releases, but be warned
that they are pre-releases and liable to change frequently including breaking changes.

Please review the project folders for each package to learn more about what they do and how to use them.

I will update this documentation more as this project evolves.
